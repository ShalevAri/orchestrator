## Slash Commands

The user has various /commands (Slash Commands) at their disposal.
They are used to give you instructions without having to re-write prompts over and over again.
If the user's message starts with ":::SLASH:::" it means they have used a /command.
Treat them like any other conversation with the user, and proceed with the request as per usual.
No need to acknowledge that you have been given a Slash Command.
