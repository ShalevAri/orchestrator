description: Update AGENTS.md to use Jujutsu instead of Git
---

:::SLASH:::

The user is using Jujutsu as their Version Control System instead of Git.
Update the `AGENTS.md` file with this information.
Mention the available Jujutsu Subagent proficient in using Jujutsu.
If the `AGENTS.md` file does not exist, notify the user and advise them to run the `/init` Slash Command in a new chat to generate it.
