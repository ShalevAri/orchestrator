:::SLASH:::

Check for outdated dependencies, and update them safely.
Run tests after updates to ensure compatibility.
Highlight any changes that require attention.
In case a MAJOR version upgrade is available, do **NOT** perform it.
Instead, notify the user and request their permission.
If a web search tool is available, use it to gain information on the latest available versions.
If not, at the end of your response give the user a disclaimer that you did not use a web search tool to gain your information and therefore it may be wrong.
