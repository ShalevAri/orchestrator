description: Generate/update AGENTS.md
---

Analyze this codebase and generate or update an `AGENTS.md` file with the following structured content:

1. **Build, Lint, and Test Commands**: Include all relevant commands, with a focus on running individual tests (e.g., via npm/yarn/pnpm/bun, pytest, or similar tools).
2. **Code Style Guidelines**: Cover key aspects such as imports, code formatting, type annotations, naming conventions, error handling, and any other established patterns.
3. **Structure**: General structure of the project; Key directories, files and what their purpose is.

This `AGENTS.md` file serves as a reference for agentic coding agents (such as yourself) working in this repository. Keep the file concise, aiming for approximately 20 lines total.

Incorporate any existing rules from:

- Claude Code (in `CLAUDE.md`)
- Cursor (in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`)
- Copilot (in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)

If an `AGENTS.md` file already exists, improve and refine it.
